// grab daily, weekly, monthly as separate elements probably
// set onclick events for them...apply an active state or just a style? TBD
// grab..the p tags in each section for changing
// there should be a way to grab it as an array and feed the json data in through array...? tbc thought
// maybe also try to figure out isolated hover states in js? when hovering over the svgs...
