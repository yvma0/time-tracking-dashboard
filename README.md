## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I revisited CSS Grid with this, in an effort to create a responsive display without having to use (too many) media query breakpoints. I also played around with clamp for font sizes, to limited effect. I hadn't accounted for both mobile and desktop formatting from the start, so I ended up having to use a breakpoint anyways... :') Something I'll have to remember for next time.

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing with Grid and fluid layouts. Additionally, I could never figure out how to isolate the hover state between the card and the ellipses button; that's something I'll have to keep looking into.
